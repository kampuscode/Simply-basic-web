                        <p class="mt-2">No other production car with the four rings is as powerful, fast or distinctive. The high-performance R8 sports car is designed for maximum dynamics in all technical areas. In the sports car world, the Audi R8 is right among the leaders in terms of its driving performance. Combined fuel consumption in l/100km: 13.1 – 12.9 (18 – 18.2 US mpg); combined CO2 emissions in g/km*: 297 - 293 (478 – 471.5 g/mi) (Information on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions as well as efficiency classes in ranges depending on the tires and alloy wheel rims used.)</p>

                        <h3><b>BMW i8</b><br><b>idr</b><font color="blue"><b> $141.695 </b></font></p></h3>
                        <p class="mt-2">BMW offers a single powertrain in the i8. It mates a turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder gas engine with an 11.6-kWh battery pack and two electric motors. The trio of power sources combines for a total of 369 horsepower, capable of driving all four wheels. However, it's not the fastest supercar on the block: The 2019 i8 roadster we tested sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds. The i8 suffers from the same light steering that we've criticized in many current BMWs. We'd prefer more feedback, especially in a vehicle with sporting intentions. The ride is surprisingly civil and bumps in the road are felt, but never harshly.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2">Hand-built and limited to 500 units worldwide, the new McLaren Senna embodies the spirit of the legendary Brazilian driver. This Ultimate Series model remains street-legal, but is first and foremost a track car. Consider the ultra-light weight, the next-generation active aerodynamic components, the evolution of the carbon fibre chassis from the 720S, the twin-turbocharged V8 unleashing 789 horsepower to the rear wheels and the race-derived adaptive suspension.</p>

                        <p class="mt-2">The absolutely stunning bodywork of the 2021 Mercedes-AMG GT will no doubt draw your eye, but it's more than just a pretty face. The low and wide GT is also an extremely capable high-performance sports car. This is Mercedes's front-engine answer to the rear-engine Porsche 911. Offered at various point points, the GT features a hand-built twin-turbo V-8. Although this AMG isn't as immersive to drive as its archrival from Porsche, it's still super athletic, and most models are surprisingly civil on streets that aren't racetrack smooth. </p>

The completely redesigned rear-drive-only coupe remains a unique entry in Subaru's otherwise all-wheel-drive lineup. The same is in store for its mechanical twin, the Toyota 86. </p>
